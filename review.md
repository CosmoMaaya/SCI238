## The sky
- celestial sphere appears to rotate from East to West
- coordinate system for the sky:
  - Latitude (Earth/NS) -> declination or Dec or Delta
  - Longitude (SW) -> Right Ascension or R.A or alpha, we fix this sky coord since stars constantly move. measured in hr/min/sec, arbitrary fixed zero position. 1h=15deg, 1min=15 arcmin, 1sec = 15arcsec, and it also can be used for time. 
  - north celestial pole altitude = observer's latitude, zenith 90deg, 

## Astronomy Origins
- a = d/theta, rad = arcsec / 206265
- zodiac: the constelaations along the Sun's path. Ecliptic = Sun's path, 23.5 deg inclined to the equator.
- solstice：至, equinox：分
- the orbits of all the planets are in very nearly the same plane in the sky: clost to ecliptic
- The inclination of Earth's rotation axis to its orbital plane is the primary cause of our seasons. 
- sidereal time: according to stars, synodic time: according to the sun. 
- solar day is 4mins longer than a sidereal day
- month -> synodic time. New moon -> waxing crescent -> first quarter -> waxing gibbous -> full moon -> waning gibbous -> third quarter -> waning cresecent
- Lunar eclipse **Full moon** only, Solar Eclipse **New moon** only (地月距离和地球位置，日地距离无影响)
- umbra: 本影, penumbra：半影
- Ancient Greek Astronomy:
  - Aristotle **Geocentrice Universe**, correct explanation of phases of Moon and of eclipses
  - Aristarchus of Samos: measured the relative distance of moon and sun

## Astrinimy as Science
- Copernicus: **Heliocentric model**, all orbits circular == wrong assumption
- Planetary Positions: Conjunction and Opposition, superior conjunction and inferior conjunction (closer) with greatest elongation. quadrature (90 elongation, superior only)
- S = 1 + (S/P) for superoir, S+1 = S/P for inferior, in years (365.25). Synodic period: **Return to the same postion from the Earth's view** (conjunction to conjunction)
- Kepler: 3 laws: orbits are elliptical, equal areas are swept out in equal time, P^2 = a^3 (year and A.U., a: semimajor axis)
- eccentricity e = c/a (c: distance from focus to center), semimajor axis is also the average distance of a body from the orbit's focus.
- perihelion (近日), aphelion(远日), helion(star)
- Galileo: phases of Venus, telescope, Pope. 

## Gravity
- temperature: measure of the average **random** energy, heat is the total random energy
- desity: rou (mass density) = n (particle number density) times average mass of particle
- pressure is force per unit area
- orbit focus = center of mass
- Lagrange or Lagrangian points
- tides: caused by differential gravitational forces across a body
  - Spring tides (大潮): new and full moon
  - Neap tides (小潮)：first-third quater moon. 
  - friction slowing Earth's rotation, and increasing EM distance

## Light
- brightness detected = power emitted / (4pi distance^2)
- power emitted = Luminosity
- wavelength (in meters) times frequency (in Hz) = c
- 400nm purple, 700nm red
- Energy of a photon: hf, h is Planck's constant 
- blackbody: continuous spectrum, absorbs and emits light at all wavelength, but not the same amount of light at each wavelength. only depends on the temperature. 
  - Wien's Law: wavelength peak: lambda_max = 2900000/T nm
  - Stefan's Law: total emission: E = sigma (constant) T^4, per unit surface area
- Doppler shift: v << c, v_rad / c = (lamb_obs - lamb_rest) / lamb_rest
  - Moving away: longer wavelength, red-shifted
- Telescopes: collecting area (proportional to aperture diameter squared)
  - resolving power: separate two close objects. resolution (rad) = 1.22 lamb/D
- reflector better. not abosrt visible and radio wave.

## Earth
- terrestrial planets: differentiated interior, strong mag field, active surface, atomosphere
- learn interiors: seismic waves (the best way), mag field, surface features, gravitational deviations. 
  - P waves: primary/pressure, fastest, bend by molten outer core
  - S waves: shear waves, stopped by molten outer core
  - surface waves
- crust, mantle (lava), liquid outer core, solid inner core
- get heated: accretion, differentiation, radioactive decay. All proportional to planet's mass or radius^3
- get cooled: convection, conduction, radiation. All through planet's surface or radius^2
- larger bodies cool more slowly
- aurora: solar wind + magnetic field. (solar wind also distorts magnetosphere)
- subduction: ocean crust heavier (density), goes under continent, melt to mantle, then volcano to give them back.
- tectonic forces can compress or stretch the crust.
- volcanism: cover up old surfaces, produce additional gas. 
- impact cratering: small: bowls, larger: central peak, largest: concentric rings.
- Erosion: atmosphere and surface water.
- Atmospheres: Earth: secondary (origin lost)
  - Exosphere, Thermosphere + lonosphere, stratosphere, troposphere
  - Greenhouse effect: heat by visible light (transparent atomo), cools by emitting IR, but atomo is not transparent to IR light, CO2 abosobs them. 
- Atmospheres: gain gas by outgssing, evaporation, impacts. Lose gas by thermal escape, solar wind, impacts, condensation, chemical reactions. 
  - temp correlates with particle velocity, thus prob of escape
  - to retain: T_limit = 75K m*M/M_R / R/R_E
  - warm air rises near equator, cools as it moves towards poles, and cooled aire sinks near poles.
  - coriolis effect => cause circulation cells to divide. 

## Terristrial
- Mercury: Long cliffs are indications of cooling and shrinking
- Venus: very few craters, resurfacing?  green house effect much greater
- Mars: weak mag field, long canyons, largest volcano in SS< seasonal exchange with atmosphere
- Moon: tidally locked, interior differentiated but not extreme. caves? lava tude
- crustal rock solidified: moon, mercury, mars, venus, earth (last)
- larger terrestrial planets: cooled slowly, more and longer lasting tectonic activity, easier to retain atmosphere. 
- closer to the sun: higher T, harder to retain liquid water and atmospheres
- higher rotation => more weather
- fewer impact craters: cool slowly

## Giant planets
- Saturn is the most oblate giant planet (rotation flatten it)
- Jovian all have differentiated interiors, J/S: molecular hydrogen, metallic hydrogen, core (rock, ice), U/N: Hydrogen/helium/methane gas, mantle(water, ammonia, methane ices), core
- Uranus does not have internal heat source?
- all 4 have strong mag fields and huge magnetosphere
- atmospheres: same structure on all, different by T_min, pressure, composition
- Bands: heat, convection, rotation
- Jupiter: layered, ammonia -> ammonia hydrosulphide, water ice, hotter but not greenhouse effect
- Saturn: smaller, similar to J
- Uranus: H, He, CH4 clouds, NOT metalic H, rotation 98deg, very strong seasonal effect. almost featureless in visible light but more details in infrared
- Neptune, unknown molecules makes colour deeper blue. 
- Jovian satellites.
  - Io: J, most volcanically active body in SS, tidal interaction and eccentric orbit heat its interior
  - Europa: J, water or warm ice
  - Ganymede: J, largest moon, smooth surface and cracked terrain => result of tidal heating and icy composition
  - Callisto: J, oldest surface of four
  - Titan: S, largest S's moon, thick atmophere
  - Mirand: U, fractured surface, violence
  - Triton: N, very very thin Nitrogen atmo, surface reshaped. 
- Saturn's rings: brightest, best known. 1 micron to 10 meters. 
  - Roche limit: distance (from surface )= 1.45 radius_planet (density_planet / density_moon) ^ (1/3)
  - Shepherd moons control the width of ring and also make gaps
